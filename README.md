## ``gm_binpkg``
Package manager for garrysmod binary modules.  
Clone and build github repos to DLLs to use in garrysmod.

This just clones the repo and compiles a file named main.cpp into a dll.

**Work In Progress**

Currently focusing on basic C++ support through gcc, will expand into Rust and C later.
